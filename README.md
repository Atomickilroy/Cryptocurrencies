# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project

#### - * Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.*

## Purpose

**The purpose of this project was to start learning tools that work hand and hand with Unsupervised Machine Learning:**

    - Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
    - Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
    - Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
    - Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
    - Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.

## Results:  

### Preprocessing the Data for PCA:

Using  Pandas, to preprocess the dataset.:

The preprocessing step gets the data set ready to be used for the unsupervised ML alogorithms. Algoritms like K-means and Heirachical Clustering only use numerical data so its important to drop the unnessessary string columns and encoded the ones that need to be used. 

###  Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA:

PCA is a statistical technique to speed up machine learning algorithms when the number of input features (or dimensions) is too high. PCA reduces the number of dimensions by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that contains most of the information in the original large set.
